### Hi there 👋

I am Romain Ledru, a French Engineer living in Germany.
I enjoy writting code that help people to fulfill everydays tasks.

I strongly think that our future will have more and more automatised processes.
As an engineer, I enjoy using new technologies to improve our lives: Code is a great way to improve processes and I have lot of fun discovering this parallel world.
